Public road transportation, as one of the sectors of transportation that is in direct contact with passengers and service users, is always subject to quality assessment judgments and evaluations. The passenger, as one of the main pillars in this system, consciously or unconsciously evaluates the services of transportation companies to make choices among available options. Therefore, one of the most important aspects that can influence the competitive market between different public transportation systems in the intercity passenger sector is the matter of services and their quality.

In this study, given the importance of services in the development of public road transportation, we first discuss various aspects of this topic in terms of general concepts, followed by a comparative study and review of other studies conducted in this field. Finally, after presenting appropriate indicators for evaluating service quality and completing and analyzing related questionnaires, suggested solutions in this area have been explained and elaborated.

In this study, considering the importance of service quality, several analytical tools have been used. In chapter three of this study, after categorizing the services provided in the public road transportation sector, the evaluation indicators in this area have been described based on comparative studies. On the other hand, since these indicators need to be refined according to the opinions of experts, stakeholders, and involved parties, internal and external factors questionnaires were designed for this purpose, and the views of this group were carefully extracted and analyzed.

What makes the issue of service quality in public road transportation even more important is the effect 123456789 that improvement in this area has on the development and increase of public road transportation's share in intercity travel in competition with rail and air systems.
