# Crowd-Analyzer: An Open-Source Tool for Advanced Crowd Behavior Analysis

Understanding crowd movement and behavior is crucial in areas like urban planning, emergency evacuation, and public safety. **Crowd-Analyzer** is an open-source tool that combines state-of-the-art computer vision with scientific pedestrian analytics. Built on YOLO object detection, ByteTrack/BotsSort tracking, and PedPy analysis framework, this tool provides researchers, engineers, and urban planners with a comprehensive platform for extracting meaningful insights from video footage of pedestrian and crowd movement.

## What is Crowd-Analyzer?

Crowd-Analyzer is a Python-based tool that processes video footage to detect, track, and analyze crowd behavior. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to:

- Detect individuals in a crowd with high accuracy.
- Track movement patterns over time using robust object tracking methods.
- Extract key statistics such as density, flow rate, and directionality of movement.
- Provide visualizations for better interpretation of crowd dynamics.
- Support real-time and offline processing for flexibility in analysis.
