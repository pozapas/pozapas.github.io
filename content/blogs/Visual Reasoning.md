# When AI Hits a Red Light in Visual Reasoning: Meet ZeroBench  

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making leaps in **visual reasoning**, handling tasks from **scientific diagram interpretation** to **gaming error detection**. But what happens when you throw **truly impossible** visual challenges at it?  

Enter **ZeroBench**, a **new benchmark** so brutally difficult that every **tested large multi-modal model (LMM)** scored a **whopping 0.0%** on its core questions. That’s right—**zero percent.** If AI had a report card, this would be the equivalent of **flunking out spectacularly**.  

## **What is ZeroBench?**  

ZeroBench isn’t just another AI benchmark—it’s an **intelligence stress test** for AI’s visual reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional benchmarks that models “solve” within months, **ZeroBench is designed to be unsolvable (for now)**, pushing AI models to their absolute limits.  

🔹 **100 handcrafted, mind-bending visual reasoning tasks**  
🔹 **Designed to exploit LMM weaknesses** in spatial reasoning  
🔹 **Intentionally unsolvable** by current AI standards  

Instead of celebrating incremental AI progress, **ZeroBench flips the script**—highlighting **gaps** rather than **achievements** in AI’s cognitive abilities.

## **🚶‍♂️ What’s the Connection to Pedestrian Studies?**  

If AI fails miserably at complex spatial reasoning tasks in a controlled test, how can we expect it to navigate real-world pedestrian environments?  

Imagine relying on an **AI-powered pedestrian detection system** based on today’s **best** LMMs:  

👀 **Human:** "How many pedestrians are in the crosswalk?"  
🤖 **AI:** "Seventeen… or maybe three. Also, is that a bicycle or a cat?"  

**The problem?** Current AI models lack the spatial intelligence needed for transportation safety, pedestrian detection, and evacuation planning.

🔹 Misidentifying obstacles and road hazards could lead to dangerous outcomes.

🔹 Misinterpreting pedestrian intent (e.g., crossing vs. waiting) could cause accidents.

🔹 Understanding complex, dynamic environments is critical for AI-driven urban safety applications.

If AI struggles to differentiate objects in a still image, how can it be trusted to navigate fast-moving, real-world scenarios?  

## **What’s Next?**  

ZeroBench isn’t just a benchmark—it’s a **wake-up call** for the AI community. **Before AI can be deployed in critical, real-world applications, it must dramatically improve its visual-spatial reasoning.**  

✅ AI must improve before handling pedestrian safety applications.  
✅ Visual cognition failures aren’t just funny—they're dangerous in real-world use.  
✅ AI researchers must rethink how models approach spatial reasoning & common sense.

### **Final Thoughts**  

🚦 AI is making remarkable progress, but ZeroBench reminds us how far it still has to go. Before we trust AI-powered pedestrian detection or urban safety systems, we need to ensure that AI can see and reason like a human—not just guess.

**What do you think? Should AI be trusted in transportation before solving ZeroBench-level challenges?**
