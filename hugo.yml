    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/me.JPG"
    content: |-
      I am a transportation engineer and researcher exploring AI-driven solutions for pedestrian safety, urban mobility, and evacuation. My work integrates AI with transportation engineering to enhance modeling, simulation, and decision-making in complex environments. With expertise in pedestrian dynamics, traffic flow, and machine learning, I develop innovative tools to improve urban planning and disaster response. As cities evolve, I aim to bridge AI innovation with real-world challenges, creating smarter and safer urban spaces.

      I am currently working on EvacuAIDi, an AI-powered framework that optimizes emergency evacuation strategies by integrating large language models (LLMs), and pedestrian dynamics modeling. This system provides adaptive evacuation guidance, especially for individuals with disabilities, ensuring a more inclusive and efficient response during emergencies.
